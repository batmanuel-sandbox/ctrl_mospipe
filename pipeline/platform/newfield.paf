   # the pattern to use for setting the root directory for a production
   # run.  The result is a directory relative to the default root directory 
   # (set via defaultRoot).  The format is a python formatting string using the 
   # following dictionary keys:
   #   runid     the unique identifier for the production run
   # 
   runDirPattern:  "%(runid)s/%(shortname)s"

   # These indicate the directory that should be used for a named purpose.
   # If relative paths are given, the resulting directory will be relative
   # to the default run directory (determined by defaultRoot and the 
   # runDirPattern).  These can be given as patterns specified in the same 
   # format as runDirPattern.  (If a directory is given as an absolute path,
   # using a pattern is recommended in order to distinguish between different 
   # production runs.)
